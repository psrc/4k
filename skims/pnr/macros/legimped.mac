~#********** legimped - 1.3 (H.Spiess EMME/2 Support Center) ****************
~#legimped - a macro to extract the first or second leg impedance matrix
~#           according to a zone index matrix containing the intermediate
~#           zones and a full impedance matrix.
~#
~#Intermediate zone index matrices are often the result of convolutions
~#computed with module 3.23.  This macro takes such a zone index matrix Kpq
~#and an impedance matrix Upq, and produces one of the following matrices:
~#
~# - the first leg impedance matrix:   R1   = U
~#                                       pq    pK
~#                                               pq
~# - the second leg impedance matrix:  R2   = U
~#                                       pq    K  q
~#                                              pq
~#
~#usage:     ~<legimped <leg> <Upq> <Kpq> <Lpq>
~#
~#where:     <leg>  =1 for first leg (pk), =2 for second leg (kq) impedances
~#           <Upq>  Impedance matrix to extract leg impedances from (input)
~#           <Kpq>  index matrix containing intermediate zone numbers (input)
~#           <Lpq>  resulting first or second leg impedance matrix (output)
~#
~#notes:     - macro is called from main menu
~#           - mo99 is used as temporary matrix
